# Weather-Journal App Project

This travel app combines my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to create an interactive app which allows the user to:

- Enter a destination city for their travel
- Count down the number of days remain before they will travel
- Check the length of their trip
- Check the weather description and temperature of their destination
- See an image of their destination

To recieve the appropriate data, the project integrates three APIs - Geonames, Weatherbit and Pixabay. If the date of travel is within a week, a current forecast will be returned. If travel dates are further in the future, a predicted forecast will be returned.
